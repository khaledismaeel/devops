# Creating a secret through `kubectl`

It is rather straightforward.

```shell
$ echo -n "my secret token" > token
$ kubectl --namespace=app-python create secret generic token --from-file=token
secret/token created
```

That's it! We can query the secret's metadata with

```shell
$ kubectl --namespace=app-python describe secret token
Name:         token
Namespace:    app-python
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
token:  15 bytes
```

Also we can query the secret's data with

```shell
$ kubectl --namespace=app-python get secret token -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d
my secret token
```

# Creating a secret through Helm chart specification (the naive way)

We created a the `secret.yaml` file in the Helm chart

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  token: {{ .Values.token | b64enc | quote }}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: token
  namespace: app-python
type: Opaque
```

We references the above file in the deployment to specify an environment variable

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
        env:
          - name: TOKEN
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: token
                key: token
```

Now we deploy our new chart as follows

```shell
$ helm install app-python devops/k8s/charts/app-python --set token="my secret token"
```

Equivalently, we could have run `helm upgrade ...` but we actually didn't have the chart installed at the time. Now we
can see our new pods.

```shell
$ kubectl --namespace=app-python get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-78f5777f69-264fz   1/1     Running   0          36s
app-python-78f5777f69-cwkqt   1/1     Running   0          36s
app-python-78f5777f69-gkkd2   1/1     Running   0          36s
```

And we can retrieve the environment variable from within the pods with

```shell
$ kubectl --namespace=app-python exec app-python-78f5777f69-264fz -- printenv | grep TOKEN
TOKEN=my secret token
```

# Creating a secret through Helm chart specification (the professional way)

We would create and publish a `secret.yaml` file which contains the token encrypted using GPG. Then we can work with
`helm secret` to have the secret decrypted upon deployment.

# Resource management

We simply add the following to our deployment specification

# Theoretical bonus

- Node selector: the simples form for selecting nodes for pods deployment. It is a set of key-value pairs indicating the
requirements for the node in order to run the pod on.

- Affinity and ant-affinity: a set of sophisticated rules to control which pods go on which node. It is basically
nodeSelector on steroids, allowing for soft and hard preferences, rules based on other pods (not only node) labels, and
others.

- Headless service: a service without cluster features like IP, load balancer, and other. Use it if you really know what you're
doing and you're mad at Kubernetes for whatever reason.

- Taint: the opposite of node affinity; it is a property that repel pods from being deployed on a certain node.
- Toleration: similar concept except that it's on the pod level.
